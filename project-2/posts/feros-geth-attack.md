After helping the colony  get back on their feet, we were on our way back to normandy when we heard a Krogan Commander yelling at a "stupid machine". After standing there for a second we realized the krogan got more frustrated but eventually when we got up far enough we could see an ExoGeni VI dismissing the krogan and revealing our presence. The Krogan Commander turns and fights us. After we defeated the krogan, i talked to the VI and it remind me that discharging weapons on company property is forbidden. It welcomes me as Lizbeth, because of her ID badge. After i aked VI questions about the Krogan Commander's last query and Lizbeth we found out that Lizbeth knew a lot more than she let on and also what ExoGeni was doing. They let a creature called the Thorian take over the colony and were studying the results.
